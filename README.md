# DEPLOYMENT

## Requirements

It's highly recommended to work in a virtual environment, but not absolutely required.

In order to run this project locally on your own system, you will need the following installed (as a bare minimum):
- Python3 to run the application
- PIP to install all app requirements
- GIT for cloning and version control
- Gitpod or any suitable IDE to develop your project

## Local deployment

- Clone this GitHub repository by either clicking the green "Clone or download" button above in order to download the project as a zip-file (remember to unzip it first), or by entering the following command into the Git CLI terminal:
git clone https://github.com/annaweronica/agile-frameworks.git
- Navigate to the correct file location after unpacking the files.
cd <path to folder>
- Create a .env file with your own credentials. An example .env file can be found here (.env_sample).
Note: the example .env file contains environmental variables for both local and remote deployment. (see below for remote deployment details)
- Install all requirements from the requirements.txt file using this command:
sudo -H pip3 -r requirements.txt
- In the IDE terminal, use the following command to launch the Django project:
python manage.py runserver
- The Django server should be running locally now on http://127.0.0.1:8000 or similar. If it doesn't automatically open, you can copy/paste it into your browser of choice.
- The Django server should be running locally now on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (or similar). If it doesn't automatically open, you can copy/paste it into your browser of choice.
- Next, you'll need to make migrations to create the database schema:
        - python manage.py makemigrations
        - python manage.py migrate
- In order to access the Django Admin Panel, you must generate a superuser:
        - python manage.py createsuperuser (assign an admin username, email, and secure password)

## Remote deployment

To deploy The House of Mouse webshop to heroku, take the following steps:

- Create a requirements.txt file using the terminal command pip freeze > requirements.txt
- Create a Procfile with the terminal command echo web: python app.py > Procfile
- git add and git commit the new requirements and Procfile and then git push the project to GitHub
- Create a new app on the Heroku website by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard. Give it a name and set the region to whichever is applicable for your location
- From the heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select GitHub
- Confirm the linking of the heroku app to the correct GitHub repository
- In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars"
- Set the following config vars:


 KEY                      | Value                          | 
| ----------------------- |:--------------------------:    | 
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID       | `<your secret key>`            | 
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   | `<your secret key>`            |
| AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME | `<your AWS S3 bucket name>`    |
| DATABASE_URL            | `<your postgres database url>` |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS         | `<your secret key>`            |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER         | `?emial adres?`                |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY       | `<your secret key>`            |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY       |`<your secret key>`             |


- From the command line of your local IDE:
        - Enter the heroku postres shell
        - Migrate the database models
        - Create your superuser account in your new database
        - Instructions on how to do these steps can be found in the [heroku devcenter documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql)
- In your heroku dashboard, click "Deploy". Scroll down to "Manual Deploy", select the master branch then click "Deploy Branch"
- Once the build is complete, click the "Open app" button provided
